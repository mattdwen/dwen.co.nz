I've had a quick project pop up, which I'm going to try and post updates about daily as I work on it.

Basically the Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust (or the Westpac Rescue Helicopter), have a system of minicams on their helicopters. The crews manually copy the recorded files after each mission. We're going to try and make that process a little bit easier for them.

The goal is to streamline the import system, ensure all the data is imported, and keep a library for archiving purposes. The footage is also often used in reality television programs such as Rescue One, so we're going to build in an export system as well.

I've decided to go with WPF, for forwards styling compatibility, plus I now like using the the MVVM methodology. I'm currently using Prism with the DIVA2 Windows Client, but I've always thought it "smelt" bad.  A tweeted a few people I know who have been using WPF (thanks [@kiwipom](https://twitter.com/#!/kiwipom)!), and they've recommended [Caliburn Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/) as a much better starting place.

> [@kiwipom](https://twitter.com/#!/kiwipom) "+1 for the ultimate troll! Prism, indeed...."

So it appears I've fallen into my old trap of having to do something easy and deciding to use something I've never used before.

Should be fun!
