I'm not going to use Caliburn Micro.

It looks very nice and all, and I plan on migrating DIVA2 applications to it, but I don't have time, patience, or ability for the learning curve at the moment.

I'll throw in a Nuget reference to Prism, and stick with what I (half) know. I've also had the realisation that I've never displayed Entity Framework models in a WPF application before, only data from REST calls. I'm not expecting it to be majorly different, though I'm not sure how the save calls to the dbcontext are going to be integrated.

I'm certainly not going to look at another ORM at this point.

The plan tonight is to get a basic config tab up and running, and maybe get the aircraft manager working between EF and WPF.
