Not much work tonight. I've setup the EF model for a Mission, and built an Import view model. Got pretty much all the Mission fields linked.

I'm having some weird issues where the validation errors are displayed before I do anything. I probably need to modify my error tracking on the models to see if anything has actually changed. Sounds like a good excuse to build that base class.

Had an expected database issue once I'd added the Mission model to the DbSet. Migrations would be the way to go, but it was easier just to nuke the DB in the debug directory for now. Since I'm using Code-First, I don't have a DB in my solution. Â Not sure how well migrations would work without that.
