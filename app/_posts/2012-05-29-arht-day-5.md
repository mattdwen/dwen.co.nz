Sounds like I've got more time than I expected on this project. It's going to be at least a month until the cameras are mounted to the helicopters. I've got a large chunk of work to do on DIVA ASAP too, so that'll take priority this weekend. I'd still like to get ARHT done this weekend too if possible.

I'm playing with displaying validation messages based on a ListBox SelectedItem. Looks like it'll just work, but it needs to look half pretty.  Not sure if I'm going to style this properly or not.  The clients are getting screenshots, so I don't want to make it look drastically different at the last moment.

I'd like to get validation from the EF models sorted tonight, so that the error messages aren't there by default. You also have to lose focus on a control before the validation updates.  Maybe TwoWay binding will solve that?

##Update 21:20
Setting the binding to UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged makes the validation update in real time. I might just live with the errors being initially shown for now.

```
<TextBox x:Name="txtDescription"
         Text="{Binding Mission.Description,
         UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged,
         ValidatesOnDataErrors=True}" />
```
