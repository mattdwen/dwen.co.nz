Been a few days since I've been able to work on this, but I've done a few hours today.

I've added a command binding system to by ViewModelBase class, which works with RoutedCommands. I've set it up so that CanExecute can be bound easily to a property, so it makes buttons automatically enable/disable based on their state.

Missions are validating and being inserted to the DB. I've decided to just use a ListBox for the list of cameras remaining to import at this stage. The spec only allows for each camera to be imported once per mission, so I just nuke the camera from the collection once I've got it.

I've designed a structure for keeping track of what has been imported already for the mission, which I'm also using to track the import starts (files retrieved, remaining, etc). Most of the code for that is in place, as well as a BackgroundWorker for handling the import. I don't think I'm going to bother with a byte by byte progress bar, just blocks of each file size. Cancel will be implemented at the start of foreach(file) loop, that way I know I have a complete file, and there's something still there worth canceling.

Biggest debate was the UI for the import progress dialog. I've gone really simple for now. Once I've got VLC previews in the library system, I might add them to the import screen.
