So I Gourced DIVA as well.

This is the main DIVA source code, since I switched to a Mercirual repository only a few months ago. I find it highly amusing that DIVA has a "big dangly thing".

This is about a years previous development, from the SVN repository. It's not the complete history.

And this is the OS X Client, again since becoming a Mercurial repository.
