Don't get a bike they said. Nah, too much fun!

That's my right clavicle, or collarbone. Shouldn't be in three pieces, or make that awesome Z shape.

Right now I'm waiting to hear if today is when they're going to put a plate on it. They weren't going to operate, and there's a 90%+ chance that will "heal" as is, but I'll always have a bump there, which would be annoying with camera bag straps and the like.

My shoulder is not that sore; it's more my headache and right hip that's annoying. I'm nil-by-mouth from midnight every night until I hear from the hospital around 9am if today's the operation day. Which means no painkillers since midnight.

I was heading up a hill, and the last corner on the crest was an off-camber right hander, which tightened. A lot more than I was expecting. There was a lot of gravel on the outside, and I tried to straighten up and get on the brakes, but must have high-sided it from there once I was in the gravel. Probably would have been better to turn in harder at that point, and slide off. Oh well. Full riding gear ftw!

Bike's not too bad from what I know. Needs a new mirror, and a lick of paint, but otherwise fine. One of the guys who stopped (who was also in a cast from a bike accident) rode it off the road and up to a house there.
