When I arrived for the first meet at Western Springs Speedway for the 2019 season I was surprised to see a midget running with sponsorship from North Shore Aero Club, where I've been working on my private pilots license since late 2018.

Not only that, but Caleb Hanham, the pilot of the 94A midget, trained with NSAC, and is currently the grounds keeper, where he's often mowing the lawns while dodging the Robins and Cessnas which frequent the airfield.

This was an oppurtunity too good to pass up, and after reaching out to Caleb, and working with the club, we arranged this shoot one early summer evening.
